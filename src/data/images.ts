// images.ts has been intentionally removed from active use.
// Per project convention we now import the bundled assets directly from
// `src/assets/*` inside components. This file remains as an empty stub to
// avoid accidental imports elsewhere during the transition.

// If you see an import from "./data/images" anywhere, update it to import
// the needed SVG/PNG from `src/assets` instead, or ask me to update those
// modules for you.
